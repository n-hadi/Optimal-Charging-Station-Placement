The program is a Python solver based on the mathematical model from the paper "Electric Vehicles Charging Network" (2014) by Joana Cavadas, Gonçalo Correia, and João Gouveia, and it uses the Gurobi optimization software. The solver is designed to solve a specific set of optimization problems related to electric vehicle charging networks, as outlined in the referenced paper. The data source for the information is https://www.standorttool.de/strom/ladebedarfe/. This dataset provides information on the projected charging demand until 2030 and takes into account the existing charging infrastructure as of July 1, 2023. The dataset was developed by RWTH Aachen, DLR, Ingenieurgruppe IVV Aachen, and funded by the Bundesministerium für digitales und Verkehr. The penalty function used in the solver is given by
